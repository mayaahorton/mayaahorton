## About Me
I am currently a Product Owner within the SKA telescope project, sitting within the Science Data Processor group. My background is in high performance computing and high-resolution numerical simulations for radio astronomy. I am also a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Cambridge where, when I am not working as PO, I undertake research into extragalactic radio astronomy. I am particularly interested in supermassive black hole binary systems and the combination of electromagnetic and continuous gravitational wave signatures for future multimessenger research. My key research question is whether or not morpological radio emission can be accurate predictors of relativistic precession. I am a member of the LOFAR Surveys KSP and have been particularly involved in the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS), among other projects. My particular focus is in crossmatching host galaxy optical IDs to complex radio components. 

## Hobbies and Interests
Outside work my main interests include creativity theory, art and HPS. Sometimes I write things. Most of my artwork is analogue these days but I have a strong interest in visualisation and art as code. I am very interested in sustainability and resource usage, including policy and mitigation. I have a lot of interest in AI/ML but I am also concerned about the negatives, both specific to astronomy and across wider society. I have the same attitude towards "shiny new things" in general; this ranges from lunar interferometric science outposts to building atomic printers on Titan. Sometimes I write about benefits and downsides of established, emerging or hypothetical technologies. I do use a lot of AI in my work.

## Languages and Experience
My PhD research was based mostly in C/C++ (numerical modelling of astrophysical jets) and Python (visualisation and image cube manipulation). I have strong HTML and CSS experience and developed the LOFAR Surveys website in 2019. I have broad Linux sysadmin experience through managing a research cluster. I have 15+ years experience with MATLAB, somewhat accidentally. I also have varying levels of exposure to IDL, GTK, Java and other random things. Before returning to astronomy my background covered a broad mix of heritage and environmental project management and research.
