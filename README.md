## About Me
I am currently a Senior Analyst at the University of Cambridge. I spent two and a half years working within the Square Kilometre Array project, initially as a developer and later as a Product Owner in helping to develop next-generation radio astronomy algorithms. I am also a long-time AI trainer and validator, because I believe that the only way of creating an ethical and intellectually valid future is by building it by hand. I am particularly interested in multimodal research.

### Astronomy Research
My research blends high-energy computational fluid dynamic simulations with projected radio maps and large sky surveys. I am particularly interested in complex low-frequency extended structure, precessing jets, and physical processes driving morphology. I have long been involved in LOFAR Surveys and been successfully awarded observing time on a number of radio telescopes, including MeerKAT and the VLA. I am particularly interested in statistical algorithms and novel data structures. My latest obsession is to redefine the role of probability space within data analytics.

### Space Sustainability
I am deputy technical lead on the European Space Agency's "Zero Debris Booklet" project for working group on the space circular economy. I am a member of the IAU-CPS and have a very long-standing interest in dark and quiet skies. I have been involved in the development of dark sky reserves and designation of dark sky sites within the UK, and am increasingly interested in not only the physical waste and repurposing of materials, but electromagnetic waste (noise and light pollution).

## Hobbies and Interests
I am drawn to anything speculative and experimental, from ecological and economic resource models to creativity theory and anything in between. If someone has an interest in researching anything, I will probably be interested. I write sprawling science fantasy novels and have a love of art, illustration and editorial design. 

## Languages and Experience
My PhD research was based mostly in C/C++ (numerical modelling), Python (visualisation and data analysis), alongside Bayesian and multivariate statistics. I have strong HTML and CSS experience (including SASS / SCSS), with some Flask, PHP and JS. I developed / am redeveloping the LOFAR Surveys and LOFAR-UK websites. I spent a couple of years as a University HPC research cluster manager which involved overseeing a £500k CAPEX upgrade to compute and storage nodes, particularly GPUs.

Beyond all that, I spent many years working as a short-form freelance artist and project manager, which means that it is essential for me to pick up new projects, softwares and concepts as fast as possible. My business now focuses on domain training for some of the world's top AI models, particularly in physics, maths and statistics, and 'fun' software engineering projects, while continuing with occasional part-time domain-driven creative design when the right project appears.
