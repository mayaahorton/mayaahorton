## About Me
I am currently a Product Owner and software developer within the SKA telescope project, where our team focuses on developing next-generation pre-processing pipelines. I am based at the University of Cambridge with a background is in radio astronomy: both observations and simulations. My personal research focuses on finding host galaxy candidates for supermassive binary black holes. My work falls firmly under the multimessenger banner and the technical issues involved in cross-matching across instruments and domains. 

## Hobbies and Interests
I am drawn to anything speculative and experimental. As a writer and artist / illustrator, my work focuses on the bread-and-butter approach

## Languages and Experience
My PhD research was based mostly in C/C++ (numerical modelling) and Python (visualisation and data analysis). I have strong HTML and CSS experience (including SASS / SCSS), with some Flask, PHP and JS. I developed / am redeveloping the LOFAR Surveys and LOFAR-UK websites. I have broad Linux sysadmin experience through managing a University research cluster and overseeing a large CAPEX project. I have 15+ years experience with MATLAB, somewhat accidentally. 

## Health and Campaigning
I am an outspoken advocate for changing the diagnostic journey within healthcare, supporting mental and physical health in the workplace, championing access to education for all, protecting minority rights and supporting survivors of domestic abuse.
