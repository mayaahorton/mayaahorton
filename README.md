## About Me
I am currently a Product Owner and software developer within the SKA telescope project, where our team focuses on developing next-generation pre-processing pipelines. I am based at the University of Cambridge with a background is in radio astronomy: both observations and simulations. My personal research focuses on finding host galaxy candidates for supermassive binary black holes. My work falls firmly under the multimessenger banner and the technical issues involved in cross-matching across instruments and domains. 

### Astronomy Research
My research blends high-energy computational fluid dynamic simulations with projected radio maps and large sky surveys. I am particularly interested in complex low-frequency extended structure, precessing jets, and physical processes driving morphology. I have been successfully awarded observing time on a number of telescopes including MeerKAT and the VLA.

### Space Sustainability
I am deputy technical lead on the European Space Agency's "Zero Debris Booklet" project for working group on the space circular economy. I am a member of the IAU-CPS and have a very long-standing interest in dark and quiet skies. 

## Hobbies and Interests
I am drawn to anything speculative and experimental, from ecological and economic resource models to creativity theory and anything in between. I write science fiction and like to draw and make things. 

## Languages and Experience
My PhD research was based mostly in C/C++ (numerical modelling), Python (visualisation and data analysis). I have strong HTML and CSS experience (including SASS / SCSS), with some Flask, PHP and JS. I developed / am redeveloping the LOFAR Surveys and LOFAR-UK websites. I have broad Linux sysadmin experience through managing a University research cluster and overseeing a large upgrade to compute and storage nodes.
