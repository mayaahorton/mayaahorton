## About Me
I am currently a Product Owner within the SKA telescope project, sitting within the Science Data Processor team. My background is in high performance computing and high-resolution simulations for radio astronomy. I am also a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Cambridge where, when I am not working as PO, I undertake research into extragalactic radio astronomy. I am particularly interested in supermassive black hole binary systems and the combination of EM and GW signatures for future multimessenger research.

## Hobbies and Interests
Outside work my main interests include creativity theory, art and HPS. Sometimes I write things. Most of my artwork is analogue these days but I have a strong interest in visualisation and art as code. I am very interested in sustainability and resource usage, including policy and mitigation. I am probably about as interested in AI/ML as the average person, but have concerns about potential downsides. Same with building things on the moon / uploading consciousness to the cloud / improbable cool-sounding concepts in general.

## Languages and Experience
My PhD research was based mostly in C++ (numerical modelling of astrophysical jets) and Python (visualisation and image cube manipulation). I have strong HTML and CSS experience and developed the LOFAR Surveys website in 2019. I have broad Linux sysadmin experience through managing a research cluster. I have 15+ years experience with MATLAB, somewhat accidentally. I also have varying levels of exposure with IDL, GTK, Java and other random things.
